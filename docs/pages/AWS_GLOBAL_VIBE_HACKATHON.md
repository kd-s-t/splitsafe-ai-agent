Make History with the Largest AI-Powered Coding Competition Ever.

Welcome to AWS Global Vibe: AI Coding Hackathon 2025, a world-class competition organized by Amazon Web Services (AWS). This public hackathon brings together developers, students, professionals, startups, and cross-industry innovators to tackle technology's boldest frontiers using next-generation AWS tools. With a MASSIVE prize pool valued over $700k+ up for grabs, this is your chance to build breakthrough solutions that blend technical excellence, creativity, and real-world impact.

## How to Participate? Register → Install → Build → Submit → Win

### MUST Install Required Tools

All participants must install and use at least one of the following AWS AI coding tools:

#### Installation Links

Choose at least one or more (FREE versions available):

- **Amazon Q Developer CLI** - Command-line interface for Amazon Q Developer
- **Amazon Q Developer in IDE** - Integrated development environment plugin (VS Code, others available)
- **Amazon Kiro IDE** - AI-powered integrated development environment
  - If you don't already have Kiro, join the waitlist at [kiro.dev](https://kiro.dev) - It's free
- **Amazon Q Developer in GitHub** - GitHub integration for code assistance
- **Amazon Q Developer in AWS Console** - AWS Management Console integration

### Using Amazon Q Developer without an AWS Account [free]

**AWS Builder ID:** Sign up for a free Builder ID using any email. This does not require a full AWS account. After registering, users can log in to Amazon Q Developer in supported IDEs or the CLI using this Builder ID. This provides access to the Free Tier limits of Amazon Q Developer, including code assistance in many programming languages beyond AWS-specific tasks. [Official Explanation](https://aws.amazon.com/q/developer/)

#### Capabilities without AWS Account

Users with Builder ID get many of the same capabilities as with an AWS account, including multi-step agentic coding, conversational AI for code help, and security scans, but with lower usage limits (free tier). The Builder ID also grants access to AWS community forums and training via AWS Skill Builder.

[More information about Builder ID](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/builder-id/)

#### Sign Up and Usage

Just sign up for a Builder ID, install the Amazon Q Developer plugin or CLI, and use the "Free Builder ID login" option in the plugin or CLI. No AWS account or billing info required.

#### Limitations

Without an AWS account, access to Pro tier features, advanced limits, or integrations (like IAM Identity Center SSO) is limited or unavailable, but the free tier is quite functional for individual and learning use.

### Using Amazon Kiro without an AWS Account

- Amazon Kiro is an AI IDE that can be downloaded and installed directly from [kiro.dev](https://kiro.dev)
- It does not require an AWS account to use
- Once installed, Kiro operates largely independently of AWS accounts but integrates with AWS tools optionally
- Users can explore spec-driven development, agentic code workflows, and other features locally without mandatory AWS cloud accounts

### Demonstrating Amazon Q Developer or Kiro is Compulsory

In BUIDL submissions, you must:
- Share screenshots
- Give context in descriptions
- Show/comment/demo the tools in your videos

**If you fail to show those tools & discuss how you leveraged them in your BUIDLs you will not be considered in the competition.**

BUIDLs don't need all tools or paid versions. The only requirements are:
1. Installing one or more of the tools
2. Demonstrating in submissions how the tools were leveraged

The tools are powerful and can help generate ideas or build entire products.
